3d goal-oriented mesh adaptivity in elastoplasticity problems

The code deals with solving an elastoplasticity problem with linear isotropic hardening. At each load/displacement step, the error based on a prescribed quantity of interest (Goal-oriented error estimation) is computed by using the dual-weighted residual method.

Based on a prescribed error bound and estimated elementwise errors, the mesh is refined/coarsened. Afterwards, the solution is projected to the new mesh and the analysis process is proceeded.

The applied methodology and the solved numerical examples can be found in the following paper:
