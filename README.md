# code-gallery
A collection of codes based on [deal.II](https://www.dealii.org) contributed by `deal.II` users

### Building the documentation

To build the doxygen documentation, check out the code gallery git repository in a directory parallel to the `<path/to/deal.II>/examples/` directory, and then build the `deal.II` documentation as [described in the readme](https://www.dealii.org/developer/readme.html#documentation). 
It will pick up the code gallery and create joint documentation for the tutorial and the code gallery.
